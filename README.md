# data-scientist-technical-test

## Data

The aim of the project is to write a functional and structured code in python using a jupyter notebook.

The code should be able to make a prediction on the dataset Auto Insurance based on the Kaggle competition:

<https://www.kaggle.com/c/auto-insurance-fall-2017>

The data can be found in this repository

The target for this project is `TARGET_FLAG`

## Submission

The project should be shared via a github, gitlab or any other public git repository kept available until the end of the technical interview.

Notebooks should be saved with outputs.

## Duration

Preparing the test should take 2 to 4 hours.

We will discuss about the project for about 20 min during the interview.

## Reviewer-recommendation

The code should explicitly:

* return the performance of the algorithms tested using the appropriate metric
* explain with markdown comment important modelling decisions including metric selection
* generate a csv file with the predictions

Performance is **not** the main goal.

The first objective of the project is to write the main steps of a data-science project with a **proper style** and **well written comments**.

The algorithms used do not have to be hyper-optimized on all parameters. However, the project should test different algorithms adapted to the type of problem.

## FAQ

The dataset contains insurance claim statics on the customers. The names of the keys and categories are nearly all transparent. We can answer specific questions on the variables but we won't provide a dictionary of variables.

The files `SHELL_AUTO` and `MEAN_AUTO` can be ignored for this project.
